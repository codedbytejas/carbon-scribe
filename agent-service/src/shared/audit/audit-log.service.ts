// Persistent sink for agent-service's audit trail (issue #578).
//
// Sink decision: a dedicated table in agent-service's own Postgres
// database, not corporate-platform's audit-trail module. That module's
// AuditEvent model is hash-chained and scoped to (companyId, userId)
// behind a JWT-authenticated, per-company API — agent-service holds only
// an internal service token (no user JWT to forward), and at least one
// agent (pdd-draft) is triggered by project-portal-side callers that have
// no corporate-platform companyId at all. Routing through it would require
// a new internal ingestion endpoint that doesn't exist today and a
// companyId this service frequently can't supply. A dedicated table keyed
// on the fields this service actually has — requestId, agent name, and an
// opaque requestedBy string — is the honest fit; see
// migrations/001_create_agent_audit_log.sql for the schema and its own
// copy of this reasoning.
//
// Failure behavior: record() does not catch or swallow a write failure —
// a `pool.query` rejection (connection refused, pool exhausted, etc.)
// propagates to the caller as a rejected promise. An audit-log outage is a
// real operational problem and should surface as one (a 500 at the HTTP
// boundary via each agent route's existing error handler) rather than
// silently discarding the entry a caller believed was durably recorded.
